# Project Title  
Temperature Monitoring System Using Arduino  

# Project Overview  
The Temperature Monitoring System measures the current temperature using a sensor and displays the value on an LCD screen.  
The system uses an Arduino Uno microcontroller and a DHT11/DHT22 or LM35 temperature sensor to read temperature values in real time.  

# Key Features  
1. Real-Time Temperature Monitoring  
   - Displays the current temperature on an LCD.  
2. Threshold Alert  
   - An LED or buzzer activates if the temperature exceeds a certain limit.  
3. Accurate Readings  
   - Uses a reliable temperature sensor for precise monitoring.  
4. Compact and Portable  
   - Ideal for small-scale monitoring systems.  

# Components Used  
- Microcontroller: Arduino Uno  
- Temperature Sensor: DHT11 / DHT22 / LM35  
- LCD Display: 16x2  
- LED Indicator: To show high/low temperature status  
- Power Supply: 5V  
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires  

# Working Principle  
1. The Arduino Uno reads temperature data from the sensor.  
2. The temperature is displayed on the 16x2 LCD.  
3. If the temperature crosses a preset threshold, the LED indicator or buzzer activates.  
4. The system continuously monitors and updates the temperature in real time.  

# Applications  
- Home and Office Temperature Monitoring  
   - Displays current temperature in real time.  
- Industrial Use  
   - Monitoring temperature-sensitive environments.  
- Weather Stations  
   - Real-time outdoor temperature display.  

# How to Run  
1. Assemble the Circuit  
   - Connect the Arduino, temperature sensor, and LCD display according to the circuit diagram.  
   - Ensure proper power supply and connections.  

2. Upload the Code  
   - Use the Arduino IDE to upload the `.ino` file.  

3. Power the System  
   - Power the Arduino with a 5V supply or USB connection.  
   - View the current temperature on the LCD.  

# Troubleshooting  
1. Incorrect Temperature Display  
   - Check the sensor connections and ensure proper wiring.  
   - Verify the power supply is stable.  

2. LCD Not Displaying  
   - Ensure the LCD connections and contrast potentiometer are properly set.  
   - Recheck the I2C or parallel communication pins.
